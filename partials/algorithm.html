  <h3>Algorithm</h3>

  <p>Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) doesn't actually correspond to a specific algorithms,
    rather a familiy of algorithms for solving problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs.
    ACO is part of the ant colony algorithms family, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence">swarm
      intelligence methods</a>.
    The main idea is to simulate real ants in their behaviour of choosing a path. Ants lay down <i>pheromone</i> while
    moving and choose the
    paths with higher quantities of pheromone with higher probability. A crucial aspect is also that pheromone
    evaporates with a certain speed.

  <p>On the above picture ants are moving between A and E until suddenly an obsicle appears on their path. Then at first
    ants in points
    B and D will essentially randomly choose whether to go towards point H or C. Ants choosing to go towards C will
    arrive at D much sooner than
    those going via H. That means the pheromone attracts additional ants to choose the route B-C-D. As B-H-D is a longer
    route then also more pheromone
    will have evaporated when the next ant starts down that path. Essentially there's a positive feedback cycle making
    the pheromone levels stronger
    on the shorter path.</p>

  <p>This is the main idea behind all of the ACO variations. The difference to real ants is that artificial ants:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>have some memory</li>
    <li>are not completely blind (they have some knowledge about distances)</li>
    <li>they will live in an environment where time is discrete</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Ant System</h4>

  <p>Ant System is the first ACO algorithm proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1991 in a paper called
    <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/paymana/swarm/colorni92-ecal.pdf">Distributed Optimization by Ant
      Colonies</a>. Ant System was applied to the well-known travelling salesman problem (TSP), where ants were used
    to find a shortest tour between a set of cities where each city is visited only once.
    More specifically we'll look at the <i>ANT-cycle</i> algorithm proposed in that paper, as that had the best results.
    The main components of the algorithm are setting and updating the trail pheromone level, and choosing the next city
    to visit for each ant. The main variables used are:</p>

  <div class="well">
    <ul>
      <li>$n$ - nr of cities</li>
      <li>$m$ - nr of ants</li>
      <li>$\rho$ - pheromone evaporation rate</li>
      <li>$\tau_{ij}(t)$ - amount of pheromone on the edge between cities $i$ and $j$ at time $t$</li>
      <li>$p_{ij}(t)$ - probability of choosing the edge between cities $i$ and $j$ at time $t$</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>The formula for updating the pheromone levels is:</p>

  <div class="well">
    <p>$\tau_{ij}(t+n) = \rho * \tau_{ij}(t) + \Delta\tau_{ij}(t,t+n)$</p>
    <p>where</p>
    <p>$\Delta\tau_{ij}(t,t+n) = \sum_{k=1}^m \Delta\tau^k_{ij}(t,t+n)$</p>
    <p>$\Delta\tau^k_{ij}(t,t+n) = \begin{cases} {Q \over L^k} \text{ if k-th ant uses edge ij} \\ 0 \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}$</p>
    <p>$Q$ is a constant and $L^k$ is the tour length of the $k$-th ant.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The formula for the probability of choosing the edge $ij$ at time $t$ is:</p>

  <div class="well">
    <p>$p_{ij}(t) = \begin{cases} \frac{(\tau_{ij}(t))^\alpha * (\eta_{ij})^\beta}{\sum_{k \in allowed}(\tau_{ik}(t))^\alpha * (\eta_{ik})^\beta} \text{ if can go to the city j} \\ 0 \text{ otherwise}\end{cases}$</p>
    <p>where</p>
    <p>$\eta_{ij} = {1 \over d_{ij}}$</p>

    <p>$d_{ij}$ is the distance between cities $i$ and $j$</p>
  </div>

  <p>Now that we have the main parts settled we can outline the algorithm is as follows:</p>

  <div class="well">
    <ol>
      <li>Set initial amount of pheromone on $\tau_{ij}(0)$ to some low constant $c$ for all $i, j$</li>
      <li>Distribute $m$ ants among the $n$ cities randomly</li>
      <li>For each ant until their tour is complete
        <ol>
          <li>Choose the city $j$ to move to, with probability $p_{ij}(t)$</li>
          <li>Mark town $j$ as visited for this ant</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Compute the tour length $L^k$ for the $k$-th ant</li>
      <li>Find the shortest tour among all ants, update global shortest tour if we found a shorter one</li>
      <li>Update the amount of pheromone by calculating $\tau_{ij}(t+n)$ for each $i, j$</li>
      <li>If we should continue, clear each ant's tour and go to step 2. Otherwise report global shortest tour</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>The original paper found the optimum values of $\alpha=1, \beta=5, \rho=0.7, Q=100$, but you can experiment and find your own values.</p>
